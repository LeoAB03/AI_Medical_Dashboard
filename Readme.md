### Online Payment Interface for Booking Appointments:
The e-Health Management System includes an online payment interface that allows users to book
appointments directly through the system. Patients can select their preferred healthcare provider, choose
an available time slot, and make the payment securely within the application. This feature eliminates the
need for manual booking and payment processes, enhancing convenience for both patients and
healthcare providers.
